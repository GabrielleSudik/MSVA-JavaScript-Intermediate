<!-- an addvantage to using deferred workers is: You create one function in the body to call the method.
And THAT method calls the deferred web worker. All that happens here is, the page gets a result about
the status of the method: done, failed, or in progress. So if the method itself changes,
this page doesn't have to, because all it gets is the status message.-->

<!-- you couldn't run your own demo, but if you could, you'd see that the worker waits
5 seconds after being asked to do something, then reports that the message was processed
to this page, appended to the unordered result-list. You can keep sending messages even
while the worker is working. Cool.-->
